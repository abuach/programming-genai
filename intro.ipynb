    "As AI and low-code platforms automate the *“how,”* the engineer’s value is shifting decisively to the *“what”* and the *“why.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "The future software engineer’s primary technical role will be more of a *system architect* Their role will be to design and connect complex systems, orchestrating a mix of cloud services, microservices, and multiple AI models. Their core technical skill will be **system design**, not just routine and repetitive coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this shift, the human responsibility for the system’s impact increases. The SWE becomes the human steward responsible for ensuring these complex, and often opaque, AI-driven systems are **secure, unbiased, private,** and **truly aligned with human values.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most valuable skills for this new era are the ones that AI cannot replicate, which include critical thinking and nuanced problem-solving, empathy and a deep understanding of user needs, business acumen and collaboration both with cross-functional human teams and GenAI programming tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This elevated engineering role, with its own unique challenges and responsibilities, is the subject of this book.\n",
