    "As AI and low-code platforms automate the *“how,”* the engineer’s value is shifting decisively to the *“what”* and the *“why.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "The future engineer’s primary technical role will be that of a *System Architect* Their role will be to design and connect complex systems, orchestrating a mix of cloud services, microservices, and multiple AI models. Their core technical skill will be **system design**, not just routing and repetitive coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this shift, the human responsibility for the system’s impact *increases*. As engineers write less of the code but direct more of its creation, the role expands to formally include *Ethical Oversight.* The engineer becomes the indispensable human steward responsible for ensuring these complex, often opaque, AI-driven systems are **secure, unbiased, private,** and **aligned with human values.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most valuable skills for this new era are the ones that AI cannot replicate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical Thinking** and nuanced problem-solving.  \n",
    "- **Empathy** and a deep understanding of user needs.  \n",
    "- **Business Acumen** and a product-minded focus on outcomes.  \n",
    "- **Collaboration,** both with cross-functional human teams and GenAI programming tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This elevated engineering role, with its own unique challenges and responsibilities, is the subject of this book.\n",
