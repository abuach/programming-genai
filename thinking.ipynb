      "\"All but 9\" means all save 9 or something like that? No.\n",

      "2. All except those who are N\n",

      "\n",
      "Suppose there are 17 sheep. \"All but 9 run away\" – so, all (meaning almost everything) ran away except for 9 that did not? No, \"all but N\" means with respect to a group, almost all of them except those in the set of size N or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it's simpler: \"but\" here is often used as an adverb meaning \"except.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, \"every student was late except for 9\" – that would be clearer, but it says \"all but 9 run away,\" which might imply a different thing.\n",

      "Let me consider the sentence structure. The farmer has 17 sheep. Then, all but 9 of them ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All but 9 of them\" is the phrase modifying \"ran away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In standard English, when we say \"all but X did Y,\" it means that almost all except for a few (X) did not do Y or something? No.\n",

      "But if I have multiple people, and all but three passed, then only three failed. So those who didn't pass are the exception.\n",

      "In many contexts, especially in older English or certain phrases, \"all but N\" can emphasize that only a small number were left out. For instance, \"We have eaten all but one of the cookies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, it says \"all but 9,\" and we're to find how many are left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I should think mathematically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let T = total sheep = 17\n",
      "\n",
      "L = left (not run away)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, according to \"all but 9 ran away,\" that means the number who ran away is all except L, so R = T - L\n",
      "\n",
      "And it says all but 9 ran away, which might mean that R is almost equal to T, with only 9 not included.\n",
      "\n",
      "But from the wordings, if all but 9 ran away, then \"all\" refers to the sheep, and \"but 9\" specifies how many were excepted from running away.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, number who did not run away = 9\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, L = 9\n",
      "\n",
      "Then R = T - L = 17 - 9 = 8\n",
      "\n",
      "But if all but 9 ran away, that means the ones who didn't run away are exactly those 9, so yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes \"all but\" can be used differently. For example, in poetry or old-fashioned language, it might mean something else, but I think for this puzzle, it's straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way: suppose he has 17 sheep, and all except 9 ran away, meaning that there are 8 who ran away (since one less than all), no.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All except N\" means T - N.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here the phrase is \"all but 9,\" which might be synonymous with \"all save 9.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in common usage, it's clear: only 9 were left behind or did not run away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, this seems like a trick question to test if you understand the phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps some people misread and think that all ran away except those who are part of something else, but there's no other group mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem says \"all but 9\" which is an absolute number here, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me consider: \"All but nine run away.\" So, from the total sheep, 9 did not run away, so they are left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, 17 - (number who ran away) = L\n",
      "\n",
      "But number who ran away is all except those 9, which is T - N if N didn't do it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Then the phrase \"all but X\" means something else? No.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase is \"all but 9,\" and then \"run away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, \"all but 9\" could be interpreted as all save 9 or almost all except for a small group including 9 individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm confusing myself with multiple meanings of \"but.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, it's probably best to assume that \"all but N\" means all except N did something. Here, ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, all except 9 ran away, meaning that only 9 did not run away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, sheep left are those who didn't run away: 9\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me see the answer from a different angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose someone thinks \"all but\" means almost none or something, but that doesn't make sense with numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if I say \"I have all but forgotten,\" it's not about quantity directly.\n",

      "But here, \"all but 9 run away\" – since there's a number given, it should be literal in terms of the exception being exactly 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, this is likely from a source that uses such phrases to confuse people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I can think about it as: he had 17 sheep. After some ran away, only 9 are left? But no, because \"all but 9 run away\" doesn't say anything directly about the remaining; it says most ran away except for exactly 9 or almost all except these 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in standard interpretation with a number, it's clear that exactly 9 did not run away if we take \"but\" as an exception word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me look up the phrase quickly in my mind. I think in this case, it means that everything is gone except for nine.\n",

      "Problem: Rectangle perimeter 40m, length = 2*width + 3, solve for length\n",
      "\n",
      "REASONING:\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have this problem: A rectangle has a perimeter of 40 meters and its length is equal to two times the width plus three. I need to find the length. Let's see, so if I let the width be W, then the length L would be 2W + 3. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2L + 2W. So for this problem, that equals 40.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 2L + 2W = 40. But since L is expressed in terms of W, I can substitute. Let me write down the equations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Perimeter: 2L + 2W = 40\n",
      "\n",
      "And length equation: L = 2W + 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, substituting that into the perimeter formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 2(2W + 3) + 2W = 40\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me expand that. That's 4W + 6 + 2W = 40, which is 6W + 6 = 40.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, subtracting 6 from both sides: 6W = 34\n",
      "\n",
      "Dividing by 6: W = 34/6, which simplifies to 17/3 or about 5.666... meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then L = 2*(17/3) + 3 = 34/3 + 9/3 = 43/3 ≈ 14.333... meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check the perimeter: 2* (43/3) + 2*(17/3) * wait no, that's not right. Let's use fractions properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "L is 43/3, W is 17/3, so perimeter should be 2*L + 2*W = 2*(43/3) + 2*(17/3) = (86/3) + (34/3) = 120/3? No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perimeter formula is P = 2L + 2W, yes. So 2L + 2W = 2(L + W).\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I messed up the perimeter calculation in my head. Better to use that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So L + W should be half of perimeter or something?\n",
      "\n",
      "Standard way: Perimeter P = 2(L + W) = 40, so L + W = 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with L = 2W + 3,\n",

      "\n",
      "3W + 3 = 20? No:\n",
      "\n",
      "L + W = (2W + 3) + W = 3W + 3, and that equals half perimeter?\n",
      "\n",
      "P = 2(L + W), so L + W = P/2.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sum: 86/3 + 34/3 = 120/3 = 40, yes that's correct.\n",

      "Length should be longer than width usually, so let's check: 43/3 vs 17/3, yes about 14.3m vs 5.67m, that seems reasonable.\n",

      "\n",
      "So length is 43/3 meters, or about 14.333m.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says \"solve for length\", so I think that's it.\n",

      "Perhaps they want numerical value or something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing: sometimes people might confuse length and width, but here it specifies length = 2*width + 3, so L is longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I should consider units or anything, but no, just meters given.\n",
